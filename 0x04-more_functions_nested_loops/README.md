# **0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops**

* This project is about more Functions and nested loops where we will advance
in these functions and loops into detailed analysis.

## Project Reqirements

### *General*

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.

* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options
-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.

* All your files should end with a new line.

* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory.

* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.

* You are not allowed to use global variables.

* No more than 5 functions per file.

* You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden.

* You are allowed to use _putchar.

* You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account.

* In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions,
but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account).

* We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the
one shown in the examples.

* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should
be included in your header file called main.h.

* Don’t forget to push your header file.

## The Protypes to be used in performing tests during the Project.

* int _putchar(char c);

* int _isupper(int c);

* int _isdigit(int c);

* int mul(int a, int b);

* void print_numbers(void);

* void print_most_numbers(void);

* void more_numbers(void);

* void print_line(int n);

* void print_diagonal(int n);

* void print_square(int size);

* void print_triangle(int size);

* void print_number(int n);

### **The Role of some of the Protypes used to test the project**

* _isupper - Checks for the uppercase charcter.

* _isdigit - Checks for a digit.

* mul - multiplies two integers.

* print_numbers - Prints the numbers.

* print_most_numbers - Prints the numbers.

* more_numbers - It prints times the numbers.

* print_line - It  creats a straight line in the terminal.

* print_diagonal - It creates a diagonal line in the terminal.

* print_square - It prints a square.

* print_triangle - It prints a triangle.

* print_number - It prints an integer.
